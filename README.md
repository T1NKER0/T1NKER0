 Some of the projects I have succesfully implemented include:
   - 4-Way Stoplight Intersection Using Logic Gates
   - Others: (I am currently in the process of re-evaluating some of my projects in order to find possible upgrade modifications.)

     NOTE: There are more projects to be uploaded as soon as I finish working on them, I look forward to sharing the applications of
           everything that I learn in due time.
